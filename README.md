Overview

This project is a Machine Learning model that classifies sonar signals as either "rock" or "mine." It is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook and employs various classification algorithms to analyze sonar frequency data and make predictions.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Sonar Mines vs. Rocks dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 208 instances with 60 numerical attributes representing sonar signals bounced off rocks or underwater mines.

Features

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature scaling and selection

Training and evaluating multiple ML models

Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-mine-predictor.git cd rock-mine-predictor

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Run the rock_mine_predictor.ipynb notebook.

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

Usage

Load the dataset and explore the features.

Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.

Train various ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.

Evaluate the model performance and make predictions.

Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between rocks and mines using sonar data. The performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics.
